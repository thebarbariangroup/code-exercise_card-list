# Card Grid/List
This coding exercise is not to test design skills or how quickly you can code. It is simply made so we can discuss the code you have written together. This exercise should take about an hour to complete. If it is taking more than an hour, feel free to stop where you feel comfortable and we can discuss the code that was written to that point.

There is boilerplate code included from this project: https://staticsiteboilerplate.com/. There is a STATICSITEBUILDER_README.md file included for this boilerplate.
You do not have to use this boilerplate if you have a different preferred project setup. 

The exercise directions are below:

## Requirements
Create a basic html grid/list of cards with each card having an image on top and some text on the bottom and an 'x' in the top right.

### The code 
Please write your JS using the OOP paradigm in ES6+
Please write your CSS using SASS

### The card
On hovering the card, cause an effect (zoom image, shift text, etc).

On clicking the card, send a js alert notifying of the card click.
On clicking the 'x' in the top right, remove the card from the DOM.

## Questions to think about before reviewing
* How long you spent on the assignment.
* What you like about your implementation.
* What you would change if you were going to do it again.
